  <h1>My hobby is: <br> Making Blueprints </h1>
<h3>I like making blueprints because I like to have something to put my ideas in. It also gives me something to think about throughout the day. Blueprints are important. For example, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) made blueprints for a early version of a plane when that was not even thought of at that time! He did the same for a submarine and other inventions even before they were made!</h3>
